//Root Node
//Children
//Parent Node
//Sibling Node
//Leaf Node--Having No child
//Internal Node -Not in boundry
//Ancestor --> Path from root to that Node
// Descendant Node --> all Node below that Node
//Level
//size --> Number of Nodes
//edges --> size-1 (is that joing two node)
// Height --> level-1

//Traversing a tree
  // 1)DFS 
  // 2)BFS

// Important properties of trees 
  // .It has no loop and no circuit
  // .It has no self loop



//Generic tree --> multiple children
//Binary tree  --> max two children(0,1,2)
//Binary search tree-> node to left is all smaller and node to the right is larger
//AVL tree--> balanced BST
